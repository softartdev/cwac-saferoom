> **üì¢ Note**: This is a maintained fork of the original [CWAC-SafeRoom](https://github.com/commonsguy/cwac-saferoom) library, which is no longer actively maintained. This fork has been updated to work with the new [SQLCipher for Android](https://www.zetetic.net/sqlcipher/sqlcipher-for-android/) API (`net.zetetic:sqlcipher-android`) that replaced the older `android-database-sqlcipher` library.

This project implements the `SupportSQLite...` series of classes and interfaces
that [Room](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room.html)
can use for working with a particular edition of SQLite. Specifically, this
project's classes connect Room
with [SQLCipher for Android](https://www.zetetic.net/sqlcipher/sqlcipher-for-android/),
a version of SQLite that offers transparent encryption of its contents.

## üì¶ Installation

### Maven Central

Add the dependency to your app's `build.gradle`:

```gradle
dependencies {
    implementation 'io.github.softartdev:saferoom.x:1.3.1'
}
```

### Maven Local (for testing)

To use a locally published version:

```bash
./gradlew :saferoom:publishToMavenLocal
```

Then add `mavenLocal()` to your repositories.

## üöÄ Quick Start

## üîÑ SQLCipher Migration

This library has been updated to use the new **SQLCipher for Android** (`net.zetetic:sqlcipher-android:4.10.0`) API, which replaced the older `android-database-sqlcipher` library in 2022.

### Why This Fork?

- **Original library no longer maintained**: The [original CWAC-SafeRoom](https://github.com/commonsguy/cwac-saferoom) is retired
- **SQLCipher API migration**: SQLCipher for Android migrated from `android-database-sqlcipher` to `sqlcipher-android` with significant API changes
- **Continued support needed**: Existing projects using Room + SQLCipher still need this integration layer

### About SQLCipher for Android

SQLCipher for Android now has its own implementation of the `SupportSQLite...` classes and interfaces. However, SafeRoom continues to provide value for:

- Projects that need a stable, tested integration layer
- Migration from older SQLCipher implementations
- Compatibility with existing codebases
